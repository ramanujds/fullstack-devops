## 1. Pre‑training self‑assessment survey

- Purpose: Understand background, confidence, and experience.
- Format: Online form with Likert‑scale and multiple‑choice items.
- Example sections:
    - Experience levels in Linux, scripting, Git, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD.
    - Learning goals and preferred style (hands‑on vs theory).

***

## 2. Theory quiz 

- Purpose: Measure conceptual understanding.
- Format: 15–20 questions (MCQ + a few short answers).
- Topics:
      - OS & networking basics (permissions, processes, ports, HTTP/HTTPS, CIDR).
      - Cloud & IAM (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, shared responsibility, IAM roles vs users).
      - DevOps and CI/CD concepts (pipelines, artifacts, rollbacks, blue/green and canary)
      - Containers & orchestration (images vs containers, pods, deployments).

***

## 3. Short practical lab 

- Purpose: Observe real hands‑on capability. Skill‑based assessments are recommended for accurate baseline and gap analysis
- Example task 
    - Clone a Git repo.
    - Edit a simple app config file and commit/push changes.
    - Build and run a Docker container from a provided Dockerfile.
    - Use basic CLI commands to check logs or hit an HTTP endpoint.

***

## 4. Grouping 

- After collecting results, will map each participant into levels (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) across key domains (e.g., Linux, Git, Docker, Cloud).
- Will use the matrix to:
    - Create mixed‑skill working groups.
    - Identify where to add optional “refresher” labs (e.g., Git basics, Linux essentials).
    - Decide which advanced sections may need more time or extra scaffolding.
