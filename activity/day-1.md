## Activity 1: Two Truths and a Bug (10–15 minutes)

**Objective:**  
Help participants get to know each other while normalizing mistakes and promoting a blameless DevOps culture.

**Materials:**
- None required (optional: virtual whiteboard or slide to capture interesting “bugs”).

**Step‑by‑step instructions:**
1. **Explain the rules (2 minutes).**
    - Ask everyone to think of three short statements about themselves related to work or technology.
    - Two statements must be true.
    - The third must describe a real “bug” story: a mistake they made in code, infrastructure, configuration, or process, plus what they learned from it.

2. **Individual preparation (2–3 minutes).**
    - Give participants a couple of minutes to write down their three statements in any order.
    - Encourage them to pick a bug story that is safe to share (no confidential data, no blaming colleagues).

3. **Sharing in small groups (5–8 minutes).**
    - Divide the class into small groups of 4–6 people (or virtual breakout rooms).
    - In each group, one person reads all three statements without revealing which one is the bug story.
    - The rest of the group discusses briefly and guesses which statement is the bug.

4. **Reveal and reflect (1–2 minutes per person).**
    - The speaker reveals which statement was the bug story and explains in 1–2 sentences:
        - What went wrong (e.g., wrong config in production, missed validation, misconfigured security group).
        - What they or their team changed afterward (e.g., added a test, changed review process, improved monitoring).

5. **Debrief with the whole class (2–3 minutes).**
    - Ask a few volunteers to share their favorite bug stories with everyone.
    - Emphasize that mistakes are expected in complex systems and the goal of DevOps is to learn, improve processes, and avoid blame.

**Facilitator tips:**
- Model the behavior by going first with your own bug story.
- Gently redirect any story that sounds like blaming others toward what was learned and how the system or process improved.

## Activity 2: Expectations Wall (10 minutes)

**Objective:**  
Capture participants’ skills and expectations so the training can be aligned and everyone feels heard.

**Materials:**
- In‑person: sticky notes and markers, plus a wall or board.
- Remote: virtual whiteboard, shared document, or online sticky‑note tool.

**Step‑by‑step instructions:**
1. **Introduce the wall (1–2 minutes).**
    - Explain that you want to understand what each participant brings and what they hope to gain.
    - Show two sections on the wall/board:
        - “Skills I bring”
        - “What I want to learn”

2. **Individual reflection and writing (4–5 minutes).**
    - Ask each participant to write **two notes** (one idea per note):
        - Note 1 (Skill): one concrete skill they bring, for example “good at scripting”, “Linux admin experience”, “security background”, “front‑end specialist”.
        - Note 2 (Expectation): one outcome they want from the training, such as “understand Kubernetes better”, “be confident with CI/CD pipelines”, “learn how to secure APIs in banking”.
    - Ask them to use short, clear phrases.

3. **Posting the notes (2–3 minutes).**
    - Participants place their sticky notes in the appropriate sections on the wall or add them to the virtual board.
    - If time allows, ask a few people to briefly read out what they wrote.

4. **Clustering and linking to the course (3–4 minutes).**
    - As facilitator, quickly group similar notes into clusters like:
        - Cloud & AWS
        - Containers & Kubernetes
        - CI/CD & automation
        - Security & compliance
        - Observability & troubleshooting
    - For each cluster, point to the module(s) in the agenda that address it and mention roughly **when** it will be covered (e.g., “Your Kubernetes expectations will be addressed in Week 2 during the EKS labs”).

**Facilitator tips:**
- Photograph or export the wall so it can be revisited during and after the course.
- At the end of the training, you can return to the Expectations Wall and ask participants which expectations were met and what they would like next.
